Some apps, built primarily to explore the new dev tools that are available in the market.

<a href="https://arungov.github.io/agam/ekadashi.html">Ekadashi app</a> was built entirely using AI tools such as claud ai. Claud AI was provided instructions of what I wanted and it did a fairly good job of building the app. We went through 17 iterations over 2 days as I ran out of tokens in the free version. I finally shifted to chatgpt since I didnt want to wait for another 12 hours for the claud ai to refresh free tokens. The good thing about claud ai is there is a render option which makes it easy to build and review the app. I did not find such an option on chatgpt. I hence ended up pushing this to github pages, which is a good idea for a longer term.
